# UFO-javaScript-HW

In this assignment, I have written a javaScript code that will create a table dynamically using the dataset that was provided to us. Th dataset is about UFO sightings in the United States.

Level 1: Automatic Table and Date Search

- Here, I have created a basic HTML web page.
- Appended a table with the following columns to the webpage which has new rows of data for each UFO sighting.
    - Date/time
    - City
    - State
    - Country
    - Shape
    - Comment
- Created an input tag which would filter the date/time column according to the provided input and render the filtered table to the webpage.

Level 2: Multiple Search Categories
- Here, I have created multiple input tags to filter the data.
- Created input tags for 
    - date/time
    - City
    - State
    - Country
    - Shape
- Based on the search criteria, the filtered table would be generated.
